/**
 * Implement Selection Sort
 * Selection sort works by selecting the minimum value in a list
 * and swapping it with the first value in the list. 
 * It then starts at the second position, 
 * selects the smallest value in the remaining list, 
 * and swaps it with the second element. 
 * It continues iterating through the list and swapping elements until it reaches the end of the list. 
 * Now the list is sorted. 
 * Selection sort has quadratic time complexity in all cases.
